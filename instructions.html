        <h2>
          Here are five things to be doing while you wait for the tow vehicle to
          arrive:
        </h2>
        <h3>1. Make Sure Your Vehicle is Parked in a Safe Spot</h3>
        If you're in traffic and you see your car obstructing the way, then you
        must stop to ensure that you it dosen't result in an accident. If the engine
        of your vehicle is running poorly, then you'll need to move the vehicle
        away from the road. If you can, turn your warning lights on. If not, it
        is suggested that you attach an object (red) to your car to enhance
        visibility.

        <h3>2. Call the Authorities (+234 803 046 9803)</h3>
        If you've been involved in an accident, make contact with the
        authorities involved to file a claim. Failure to report an accident
        could have serious legal consequences. In addition, if you intend to
        submit a claim to your insurance company for autos, you'll need an
        insurance claim number. If the accident happened through the negligence
        of someone else, the claim number is requested by your insurance
        provider.

        <h3>3. Remove Your Valuables</h3>
        While you're waiting, make sure to take important or
        valuable things out of your  car. It's the same for things with sentimental
        value too. This will not only give you peace of mind it also will ensure
        that you've got everything you need and do not have to drive to the
        place where your vehicle is stored while waiting for repairs. Towing
        companies aren't responsible for any damage or loss of personal
        belongings that are left in your car.

        <h3>4. Stay Calm and Do Not Dehydrate</h3>
        Following the tips above, now all you have to do is wait and remain at
        peace. It is suggested that you make sure you don't overuse the battery
        of your phone. You never know when you will require a phone call. Make
        sure you drink plenty of water. If you're close to the urban area, the
        tow truck could be able to take just some minutes to reach you. However,
        when you live far away from the urban area, it might take up to an hour
        or more.

        <h3>5. Consider Staying Inside Your Car</h3>
        If there's nothing that you can do but just wait until the tow truck to
        show up, then it's highly recommended to remain in your car as it's
        extremely risky to walk or stand in your vehicle in a busy road.
